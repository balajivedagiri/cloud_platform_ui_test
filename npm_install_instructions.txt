Steps:

npm install axios
npm install react-router-dom
sudo npx create-react-app my-vm-frontend
npm start

To run the frontend application created with React, you'll need to follow these steps:

    Install Node.js and npm: If you haven't already installed Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager), download and install them from the official website: Node.js Downloads.

    Create a React App: If you haven't already set up a React project, you can create one using Create React App. Open a terminal and run the following command:

    bash

sudo npx create-react-app my-vm-frontend

Navigate to the Project Directory: Move into the project directory using the following command:

bash

cd my-vm-frontend

Replace the src Directory: Replace the contents of the src directory in your React project with the code provided for the frontend application. You can create a new file named CreateVMForm.js in the src directory and paste the code for the frontend component in it.

Install Axios: If you haven't installed Axios yet, install it using npm:

bash

npm install axios

Run the Application: After setting up the project and installing dependencies, you can start the development server by running:

bash

npm start

View the Application: Once the development server is running, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view your React application. You should see the form for creating VMs.

Interact with the Form: You can now interact with the form by filling in the required fields and submitting the form. Make sure your backend server (Flask server hosting the create_vm API) is also running so that the frontend can make requests to it.
